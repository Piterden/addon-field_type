# Addon Field Type 

`anomaly.field_type.addon`

The addon field type allows users to select any available addon as configured. It is often used as a hidden field to create a relation between an entry and an extension extensions.

For example, the Pages module uses an addon field type for the relation between page types and the page handler extension to use for said page type.
